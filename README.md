# CodeRefactor

The goal of this activity was to clean up the CSS and HTML files while keeping the web page optics exactly the same.  The reason we do this is to optimize the search engine responsiveness and provide accessibility to users with disabilities, for example.

I began by renaming the title so that the tab reflects the same name as the company on the page.  I then renamed most of the <div> elements to semantic HTML tags instead, which made the code far easier to read and follow.  Also, I re-ordered items in CSS so that they were logically next to each other. I added alternative text to each image so that a digital reader can identify them. Finally, I added comment lines to both the HTML file and the CSS file to remind myself or others what each part is.
  
After multiple trials and errors I was able to complete the activity while maintaining the web page appearance. This was a great activity in learning to stay organized and logical in naming items.
